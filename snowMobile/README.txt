Dear customer.
Welcome to the first social network for voip business. Here is a point to exchange routes, automatically posting routes to twitter, quick search/add routes and many, many perfect features to do business in voip pretty easy.
At first, system will setup necessary issues to make you life comfortable. It's usually take 10-15 sec. After that, u can click to configuration button up there. In configuration you can add/join to you company and also change name/email/password. We are asking you to fill all data and register. we are like to show for other users only real company names, so please fill it true, or, if you don't like to share company name, just hide it in company menu. Companies, which will live unhides and with not real names, will hide automatically after few days. Then, you can authorize app for twitter account. If you will do this, all routes, which you add in system, will populate on twitter. It's a good way to inform other community that you looking routes, why not? :)
After registration complete, please add some carriers to system. It will help to understand for you colleague, which carrier exactly pushed this route, and speed up deals. Of course, if you don't like to share it, just keep one carrier. it may be you first carrier as well ;-).
A first person, who will create company, will be admin of this company. That means what other people must join to this company, and admin will approve them to collaborate with routes. U need just a wait around five minutes, and system will automatically shown registration avaiting approve inside configuration area.
Next step is using Events. Holidays usually increase incoming traffic to according countries,that is a reason why it important to know, when holiday will be. We have great variety of calendars here (exact list you can see on http://www.ixc.ua/iPhone/countries.txt). If you are familiar with previous version, you can easy to using it at same interface, but with little trick. From any country event you can add route to push list to just one touch. Good point to tell to colleague: "oh, we are missed to open china/mobile for our carriers". And don't forget using amazing calendar integration with events - just choice "Added to calendar" and appropriate notification will added to u iphone (if you familiar for MobileMe integration, you calendar will shared to desktop also).
And finally, you can using amazing Routes interface. As first look, it's looking empty. Right, we are don't know where is u push list exactly :).
Just press to add routes, search for country/specific/code. Then make long press on necessary route and long press. Thats all.
Some tip - you can resize all routes by fingers, if you will need to see all codes for this destination.
And then, when all necessary routes add, just press routes list and fill details. There is everything, what you need to share. And also status of this object to understand sync progress. This is a beta stage of project, so we will remove statuses as well when beta will passed.
Last point. Your are really tired and like to moving, but this is really last point :). You can using a same service on you desktop computer as well. On App Store for mac application with a same name doing a better issues like automatically parsing excel push list's and have a same functions also. all you data will sharing everywhere you like to using it. For windows customers, please using a lot of Macs emulators as well. So, now join an enjoy!
